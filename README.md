# FontAwesome for Elm. [![Build](https://github.com/Lattyware/elm-fontawesome-generator/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lattyware/elm-fontawesome-generator/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Publish](https://github.com/Lattyware/elm-fontawesome/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lattyware/elm-fontawesome/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

This is an Elm library for [FontAwesome][fa]. This does not rely on any external javascript (e.g: using the
JavaScript library to replace nodes, which can cause issues with Elm), and unlike the font, only includes the icons you
use in your Elm code if you minify your output, as well as providing access to the powerful transformation, layering,
text, counter, and masking features.

## How it works.

This package is generated using [the FontAwesome SVG JavaScript Core][fa-core].
If you are interested in how this is done, would like to make a version of the library for pro icons, or want to
update to a new version of FontAwesome (do also feel free to submit an issue if the library is out of date) please see
[the generator repo][elm-fontawesome-generator].

This does mean that this is a big package, the compiled Elm code weighs in at over 1MB. This would naturally not be
ideal in most situations. The good news is that it is easy to minify out any unused icons thanks to Elm's pure nature.
If you are already minifying your compiled Elm (which is good practice anyway), then you don't need to do anything
more. If you are not, then [it is simple to do][minification]. This will result in perfect subsetting - you only ship
the icons you use.

## Using the elm library.

The easiest way to use the library is to install the elm package directly: `elm install lattyware/elm-fontawesome`.

Once you have done that, the best place to start is at [the `elm-fontawesome-example` project][elm-fontawesome-example]
which should give you a good idea of what you can do and how to do it. For more detail on the available options, please
see [the documentation][docs], which gives an exhaustive description.

### Function names.

In general, names are just the camel-cased version of the original name. E.g: `arrow-alt-circle-right` becomes
`FontAwesome.Solid.arrowAltCircleRight`. Where the first character of the name isn't valid as an Elm identifier, the
name is prefixed with `fa`, e.g: `500px` becomes `FontAwesome.Brands.fa500px`. Note this applies to the
`FontAwesome.Attributes` module as well, so `2x` becomes `FontAwesome.Attributes.fa2x`.

### Required CSS.

FontAwesome does require some CSS styles. You can either use `FontAwesome.Styles.css` to include an HTML `style` node
with the necessary code directly in your page in Elm, or you can include the CSS from
`@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/svg-with-js.min.css` in your page however you choose. Do note you do _not_ need the
webfont version - the icons in this package are rendered with SVG, and while that CSS will work, you will make your
users load a webfont for no reason.

### Styling icons.

Font Awesome supports [styling your icons][styling] in various ways. These styles are exposed as attributes for the
various classes in the `FontAwesome.Attributes` module.

## Differences in behaviour from the official library.

While effort has been made to produce the same output where possible, some differences from the official library do
exist:

- We don't produce or consume any `data` attributes as we won't use them from Elm code anyway.
- When masks are created, the official library generates random ids to avoid collisions from multiple icons on the
  same page. In Elm, this is impossible to do without exposing it in the API, so we don't. If you need ids you will
  need to manually specify them. It is possible to use random ids, please see the example for more.

## Troubleshooting.

### Icons show up as giant images.

This normally means you have not [included the required CSS](#required-css).

### My class isn't applied, or it is but the icon breaks.

Mixing `Svg.Attribute.class` and `Html.Attribute.class` can cause the classes to get overwritten. This library uses
`Svg.Attribute.class`, so if you always use this when providing attributes to the library you should not have problems.
